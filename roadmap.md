# 🛠 Engineer’s Roadmap (HIVE-PAW Path)

## Stage 0 — Foundations (where you are now)
- ✅ Run Python scripts from CMD / PowerShell  
- ✅ Serve API with FastAPI + Uvicorn  
- ✅ Use JSON files for persistence  
- ✅ Debug stack traces & syntax errors  

🎯 Goal: Comfort with starting/stopping your API, reading error logs, fixing “red screen” issues.

---

## Stage 1 — Python & API Core
- Functions, indentation, return values  
- Modules & imports  
- Exceptions (`try/except`) for cleaner error handling  

**FastAPI essentials**:
- `@app.get`, `@app.post`  
- Query vs path params (`/ledger/{date}` vs `/ledger?date=…`)  
- Response models (Pydantic for validation)  

🎯 Practice: Add an `/echo` endpoint that just returns whatever JSON you send it.  

---

## Stage 2 — Persistence & Data
- JSON read/write  
- SQLite or TinyDB → move from flat files to a small DB  
- Learn about migrations  

🎯 Practice: Store sweeps/seeds in SQLite instead of `.json` files.  

---

## Stage 3 — Testing & Automation
- Use Python `requests` for API tests  
- Write unit tests with `pytest`  
- Automate daily backup tests  

🎯 Practice: Run `pytest` that seeds → sweeps → seals → verifies, and check all pass.  

---

## Stage 4 — Systems & Security
- Environment variables (`LEDGER_HMAC_KEY`)  
- Hashing (SHA256, HMAC) for tamper-evidence  
- File permissions & basic ops security  

🎯 Practice: Make `/verify/{date}` reject altered `.json` files.  

---

## Stage 5 — Scaling Up
- Dockerize FastAPI app  
- Add logging & monitoring  
- Explore async (`async/await`)  

🎯 Practice: Run the same API in Docker on another machine.  

---

## Stage 6 — Full-Stack Bridge
- Frontend basics: HTML + JS `fetch()`  
- Simple dashboard that calls `/ledger/latest`  
- Eventually connect to the **HIVE app/game UI**  

🎯 Practice: Build a webpage that shows the latest sweep/seal from your API.  

---

## Stage 7 — Mastery Track
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions auto-test & deploy)  
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Fly.io, Render, etc.)  
- Architecture design: scaling ledgers, distributed consensus, microservices  

🎯 Practice: Host your API publicly, with auto-deploy pipeline from GitHub → cloud.

📌 **How to climb this ladder**
- Focus on one rung at a time.  
- Each rung = one concept + one practice.  
- Keep a **Notepad log of bugs & fixes** — that’s your engineer’s diary.
